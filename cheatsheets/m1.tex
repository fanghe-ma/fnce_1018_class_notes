\begin{definition}
    \textbf{Gross Domestic Product (Product Approach)} is defined as the market value of final goods and services newly produced within a nation during a fixed period of time.
\end{definition}

\textbf{Market value}: prices at which goods and services are sold
\begin{itemize}
    \item (+): Allows adding of production of different goods and services
    \item (-): Some goods or services are not sold in formal markets, denoted \textbf{nonmarket goods and services}.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Newly produced}: GDP only includes goods and services produced within current period.

\textbf{Final}: Goods and services are final if they are not intermediate. Goods and services are intermediate if they are used up in the production of others \textbf{in the same period they were produced}. \textbf{inventories} are a final good. 

\begin{definition}
    \textbf{Gross National Product} is defined as the market value of final goods and services newly produced \textit{by domestic factors of production} during the current period.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    \textbf{NFP} or \textbf{Net factor payments from abroad} is defined as the income paid to domestic factors of production by the rest of the world minus income paid to foreign factors of production by the domestic economy.
    \[
        \text{GDP} = \text{GNP} - \text{NFP}
    \]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    \textbf{Income-Expenditure Identity}: The \textbf{Gross Domestic Product} (Expenditure Approach) is defined as the total spending on final goods and services produced within a nation during a specified period of time. 
    \[
        Y = C + I + G + NX
    \]
\end{definition}


\textbf{Investment} includes spending on
\begin{itemize}
    \item fixed investment: spending on new capital goods
    \begin{itemize}
        \item business fixed investment
        \item residential investment
    \end{itemize} 
    \item inventory investment: spending on inventory holdings
    \begin{itemize}
        \item including produced goods that are unsold
    \end{itemize} 
\end{itemize} 

\textbf{Government purchases} of goods and services include expenditure by government for a currently produced good or service, foreign or domestic. \\

Note that $G$ excludes
\begin{itemize}
    \item transfers 
    \item interest payment on national debt
\end{itemize} 

Government spending on fixed investments or inventory is counted under $G$, not $I$.

\begin{remark}
\[
    GNP = NNP + Depr + NFP
\]
\[
GDP = GNP + NFP
\]
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}
    \textbf{Private disposable income} is the amount of income that the private sector has available to spend.
    \[
       Y + NFP + TR + INT - T
    \]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    \textbf{Net government income} is taxes paid by private sector, minus payments from government to the private sector 
    \[
        \text{net government income} = T - TR - INT
    \]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    \textbf{Private saving} is defined as the difference of private disposable income and consumption 
    \begin{align*}
        S_{pvt} = (Y + NFP - T + TR + INT) - C
    \end{align*}
\end{definition}


\begin{remark}
    Note that \textbf{investments} is not subtracted from private disposable income even though it constitutes private spending, because it \textit{does not satisfy current needs}.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}
    \textbf{Government saving} is defined as net government income, less goernment purchases of goods and services 
    \begin{align*}
        S_{govt} = (T - TR - INT) - G
    \end{align*}
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
    \textbf{Government budget surplus} is defined as government receipts less outlays 
    \begin{align*}
        \text{budget surplus} &= T - (G + TR + INT) \\
        &= S_{govt}
    \end{align*}
\end{remark}

\begin{theorem}
    \textbf{Uses-of-saving identity} The economy's private saving is used in 3 ways 
    \[
        S_{pvt} = I + (- S_{govt}) + CA
    \]
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}
    \textbf{National Wealth} is the total wealth of residents in a country, consisting of 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item domestic physical assets, i.e. capital goods and land
        \item net foreign assets, comprising of 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item (+) foreign physical and financial assets 
            \item (-) foreign physical and financial liabilities 
        \end{itemize} 
    \end{itemize} 
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}
    The \textbf{GDP deflator} is a price index that measures the overall level of prices of goods and services included in GDP. 
    \[
        \text{GDP deflator} = 100 \times \frac{ \text{nominal GDP}}{ \text{real GDP}}
    \]
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}
    The \textbf{Consumer Price Index}, or \textbf{CPI}, measures the prices of consumer goods, calculated as 100 times the current cost of a specific baset of consumer items divided by the cost of the same basket in the reference base period.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
    The CPI tends to overstate increases in cost of living because of
    \begin{itemize}
        \item improvements in quality of goods and services
        \item substition bias
        \begin{itemize}
            \item CPI doesn't account for substitution away from the specified basket of goods
        \end{itemize} 
    \end{itemize} 
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}
    \textbf{Inflation rate} for a given period is defined as the percentage change in the price index in the same period.
    \[
        \pi_{t + 1} = \frac{P_{t + 1} - P_t}{P_t} = \frac{\triangle P_{t+1}}{P_t}
    \]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    The \textbf{real interest rate} on an asset is the rate at which the real value or purchasing power of the asset increases over time. \\


    The \textbf{nominal interest rate} on an asset is the rate at which the nominal value or purchasing power of the asset increases over time.

    \begin{align*}
    \text{real interes rate} &= \text{nominal interest rate} - \text{inflation} \\
    &= i - \pi
    \end{align*}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    \textbf{Expected real interest rate} is the nominal interest rate minus expected rate of inflation. 
    \[
        r = i - \pi^e
    \]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    The \textbf{Marginal product of capital} is the increase in output produced that results from a one-unit increase in capital stock. 
    \[
        MPK = \frac{\triangle Y}{\triangle K}
    \]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    The \textbf{Marginal product of labor} is the increase in output produced that results from a one-unit increase in labor. 
    \[
        MPN = \frac{\triangle Y}{\triangle N}
    \]
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
    The $MPK$ and $MPN$
    \begin{itemize}
        \item are positive 
        \item are decreasing in $K$ / $N$, due to diminishing marginal product
    \end{itemize} 
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
Given a decrease in $A$, 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item the marginal product decreases for every value of $N$
        \item the amount of output decreases for every value of $N$
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Marginal revenue product of labor} is the benefit of employing an additioinal worker in terms of the extra revenue produced. 
    \[
        MRPN = P \times MPN
    \]
\end{definition}

The quantity of labor demanded is 
\begin{itemize}
    \item in nominal terms: equal to the $MRPN$
    \item in real terms: equal to $MPN$
\end{itemize} 

\begin{definition}
    \text{Real wage} refers to the wage measured in terms of units of output.
    \[
        w = \frac{W}{P}
    \]
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
    Note that firms will want to increase employment under the following condition, all 4 statements are equivalent
    \begin{align*}
        & MPN > w  \\
        \iff & MPN > \frac{W}{P}  \\
        \iff & P \times MPN > W  \\
        \iff & MPRN > W 
    \end{align*}

    Vice versa for condition under which the firm will want to decrease employment
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
Factors that affect labor demand must change the amount of labor that firms want to employ \textit{at any given level of the real wage}.\\

The labor demand increases in response to 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $A \uparrow$, productivity improvements / positive supply shock
    \item $K \uparrow$, increase in capital supply
\end{itemize} 
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}
    The \textbf{substitution effect} refers to an increase in the opportunity cost of leisure causing workers to substitute away from leisure towards work.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
    \textbf{Pure substitution effect}: one-day rise in real wage, $NS \uparrow$.  \\
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}
    The \textbf{income effect} refers to workers being better off and hence working less.
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
    \textbf{Pure income effect}: changes in $Z$, e.g. winning the lottery, or higher expected future real wages, $NS \downarrow$ \\
\end{remark}

\begin{remark} 
    \textbf{Income} and \textbf{substition} effect work in opposite directions on labor supply.  \\

    An increase in real wages 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item raises the marginal benefit of work, increases labor supply, by \textbf{substitution effect}
        \item increases workers' wealth, decreases labor supply, by \textbf{income effect}
    \end{itemize}   
\end{remark}


\begin{remark}
The labor supply shifts left in response to 
\begin{itemize}
    \item increases in weath, $NS \downarrow$
    \item increases in expected future real wage, $NS \downarrow$
    \item decrease in working age population
    \item decrease in participation rate
\end{itemize} 
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}
    \textbf{Full-employment level of employment}, $ \bar{N} $ is defined as the equilibrium level of employment. The corresponding market-clearing real wage is $ \bar{w} $.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    \textbf{Full-employment output}, $\bar{Y}$, also called \textbf{potential output}, is the level of output that firms in the economy supply when wages and prices have fully adjusted. 

    $\bar{Y} $ is achieved when aggregate employment reaches its full-employment level, $\bar{N}$
    \[
        \bar{Y}  = AF \left( K, \bar{N}  \right) 
    \]
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
    A decrease in $A$ reduces $\bar{Y} $ in two ways
    \begin{itemize}
        \item  $A \downarrow \rightarrow \bar{Y} \downarrow$ directly 
        \item  $A \downarrow \rightarrow MPN \downarrow \rightarrow ND \downarrow \rightarrow \bar{N} \downarrow \rightarrow \bar{Y} \downarrow $ 
    \end{itemize}

    Classification of individuals:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $E$, employed, if person worked full-time or part-time during the past week
        \item $U$, unemployed, if person didn't work during the past week but looked for work in the past four weeks
        \item $NLF$, not in labor force, if the person didnt work and didn't look for work in the past 4 weeks
        \begin{itemize}
            \item discouraged workers, people who become discouraged and move from $U$ to $NLF$
        \end{itemize} 
    \end{itemize} 
    \begin{align*}
        \text{labor force} &= LF =  E + U \\
        \text{adult population} &= LF + NLF \\
        \text{participation rate} &= \frac{LF}{LF + NLF} \\
        \text{employment ratio} &= \frac{E}{LF + NLF}
    \end{align*}
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
    Sources of unemployment 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{frictional unemployment}: arises as workers search for suitable jobs and firms search for suitable workers
        \item \textbf{structural unemployment}: long-term and chronic unemployment that exists even when the economy is not in a recession
        \begin{itemize}
            \item unskilled, low skilled workers
            \item rellocation of labor from shrinking industries / depressed regions
        \end{itemize} 
    \end{itemize} 
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}
    The \textbf{natural rate of unemployment}, $ \bar{u} $ is the rate of unemployment that prevails when output and employment are at the full-employment level. \\

    The difference betwen actual unemployment and natural unemployment is \textbf{cyclical unemployment} 
    \[
    \text{cyclical unemployment}= u - \bar{u} 
    \]
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
    \textbf{Okun's Law} states that the gap between full-employment output and actual output increases by 2 percent for each percent increase in unemployment 
    \[
    \frac{\bar{Y} - Y }{\bar{Y} } = 2 \left( u  - \bar{u}  \right) 
    \]

    Alternatively, the percentage change in real output is roughly 3 percent minus two times the change in unemployment
    \[
    \frac{\triangle Y}{Y} = \frac{\triangle \bar{Y} }{ \bar{Y} }  - 2 \triangle u
    \]
\end{theorem}


\begin{definition}
    An individual's \textbf{Present Value of Lifetime Resources, $PVLR$} is defined as 
    \[
        PVLR = a + y + \frac{y^f}{1 + r}
    \]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    An individual's \textbf{Present Value of Lifetime Consumption, $PVLC$} is defined as 
    \[
        PVLC = c + \frac{c^f}{1 + r}
    \]
\end{definition}



\begin{definition}
    An individual's \textbf{budget constraint} is given by
    \begin{align*}
        PVLC &= PVLR \\
        c + \frac{c^f}{1 + r} &= (a + y) + \frac{y^f}{1+r} \\
        c^f &= (a + y - c) (1 + r) + y^f \\
        &= \underbrace{(a + y)(1 + r)+ y^f}_{intercept}   \underbrace{ - (1+r)}_{slope} c 
    \end{align*}
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
    We can classify individuals as lending or borrowing 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item lending, if $c < a + y \iff a + y - c > 0$
        \item borrowing if $c > a + y \iff a + y - c < 0$
    \end{itemize} 
\end{remark}


\begin{remark}
    We can classify individuals as saving or dissaving
    \begin{itemize}
        \item saving, if $y > c$
        \item dissaving, if $y < c$
        \begin{itemize}
            \item borrowing, if $c > y + a \iff a + y - c < 0$
        \end{itemize} 
    \end{itemize} 

    \textbf{Dissaving} $\neq$ \textbf{Borrowing}.

    Income effect occurs when 
    \begin{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item $PVLR \uparrow$
        \item $r$ unchanged

\begin{definition}
    A firm's \textbf{desired capital stock} is the profit-maximizing amount of capital for the firm.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
    The profit-maximizing level of capital is achieved when the expected future marginal benefit, \textit{expected future marignal product of capital}, $MPK^f$ is equal to the expected future marginal cost, \textit{user cost of capital}.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}
    The \textbf{user cost of capital} is the expected real cost of a unit of capital for a specific period of time.  
    \[
        uc = (r + d) p_K
    \]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    The \textbf{tax-adjusted user cost of capital} is the user cost of capital divided by $1 + \tau$ where $\tau$ is the tax rate on firm revenues. \\
    \[
        \frac{uc}{1 - \tau} = \frac{(r + d)p_K}{1 - \tau}
    \]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    \textbf{Gross investment} is defined as the total purchase or construction of new capital goods. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    \textbf{Net investment} is defined as the difference between gross investment and depreciation.
    \[
    \underbrace{K_{t + 1} - K_t}_{\text{net investment}} = \underbrace{I_t}_{\text{gross investment}} - \underbrace{dK_t}_{ \text{ depreciation}}
